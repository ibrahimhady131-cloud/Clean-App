# Workspace

## Overview

Arabic RTL cleaning services mobile app (نظافة) built with Expo + Supabase backend. Full RTL support, Cairo/Tajawal Arabic typography, premium green aesthetic. Includes admin dashboard at `artifacts/admin/` and Express API at `artifacts/api-server/`.

## How to run (one-click)

The "Start application" workflow runs `bash scripts/start-all.sh`, which kills any stale processes on ports 8080/18115/23744 and then launches all three services in parallel:

- API server → port 8080
- Admin dashboard → port 23744 (`/admin/`)
- Mobile app (Expo) → port 18115

The artifact-specific workflows (artifacts/mobile: expo, artifacts/admin: web, artifacts/api-server) will show "failed" while Start application is running because they would bind to the same ports — that is expected. Use them only if you stop Start application and want to run a single service.

## Theme + i18n + maps

- **Theme system**: `lib/theme.tsx` provides a `ThemeProvider` with `light` / `dark` / `system` modes, persisted in AsyncStorage. `hooks/useColors` reads from this provider. Both palettes already exist in `constants/colors.ts`. The toggle lives in **Settings → Appearance**.
- **i18n system**: `lib/i18n.tsx` provides `I18nProvider`, `useI18n()` and `useT()` for the `t(key)` function. Languages are `ar` (default) and `en`, persisted in AsyncStorage. Switching language calls `I18nManager.forceRTL(...)` and triggers `expo-updates.reloadAsync()` (or web reload) so layout direction flips correctly. Toggle lives in **Settings → Language**. Translations cover the most-visible screens: onboarding, login, signup, home, services, profile, settings, address-form. Other screens fall back to Arabic until more keys are added to the dictionary in `lib/i18n.tsx`.
- **Maps**: `components/AppMap.tsx` (web) renders real OpenStreetMap tiles with custom markers and polyline overlay. `components/AppMap.native.tsx` uses `react-native-maps`. They're used identically on home, tracking, provider home, provider booking-details, and address-form. Real GPS lookup + reverse geocoding lives in `lib/location.ts` (`getCurrentResolved` uses `expo-location.reverseGeocodeAsync` on native, Nominatim on web). Saved addresses store real `lat`/`lng`/`district`/`region` from the geocoder.

## Routing notes

- `app/index.tsx` is a router-only screen: it routes to `/(tabs)/home` for users/guests and `/(provider)/home` for providers/admins.
- The tab home pages live at `app/(tabs)/home.tsx` and `app/(provider)/home.tsx` (NOT `index.tsx` — keeping them as `home.tsx` avoids a URL collision with `app/index.tsx` which previously caused "page not found" on web).
- `lib/auth.tsx` auto-creates a profile row from `user_metadata` if the DB row is missing, so the app never deadlocks on login/signup.
- `lib/serviceImages.ts` provides curated Unsplash image URLs per service category and a static fallback for categories/services so the UI is never empty when Supabase is unreachable.

## Mobile App Structure

`artifacts/mobile/` — Expo app:
- `app/onboarding.tsx` — 3-panel intro carousel
- `app/login.tsx` / `app/signup.tsx` — Auth screens
- `app/index.tsx` — Root redirect (checks onboarded → role → route)
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` — Home (map + booking CTA + services scroll)
- `app/(tabs)/bookings.tsx` — My bookings
- `app/(tabs)/offers.tsx` — Offers & promotions
- `app/(tabs)/chat.tsx` — Messages
- `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` — User profile (real data from auth + Supabase)
- `app/(provider)/index.tsx` — Provider home (nearby orders, stats, map)
- `app/(provider)/bookings.tsx` — Provider's accepted bookings
- `app/(provider)/wallet.tsx` — Earnings + transaction history
- `app/(provider)/profile.tsx` — Provider profile
- `app/provider-edit.tsx` — Edit provider profile (saves to Supabase)
- `app/withdraw.tsx` — Withdrawal request screen
- `app/statement.tsx` — Provider earnings statement
- `app/booking.tsx` — Date/time/cleaner selection
- `app/tracking.tsx` — Live cleaner tracking with map
- `app/rating.tsx` — 5-star feedback
- `app/payment.tsx` — Payment methods + order summary
- `components/AppMap.tsx` / `AppMap.native.tsx` — Platform-split map wrapper
- `lib/auth.tsx` — Auth context (session, profile, signIn/signUp/signOut)
- `lib/supabase.ts` — Supabase client

## Admin Dashboard

`artifacts/admin/` — Vite + React admin panel:
- Uses `CRUDPage` component for all CRUD operations
- Tables managed: providers, bookings, services, categories, customers, withdrawals, refunds, notifications
- `CRUDPage.tsx` strips nested objects from update/insert payload
- To run: `pnpm --filter @workspace/admin run dev`

## DB Migration

`artifacts/mobile/db/migration_v2.sql` — adds `services text[]` and `areas text[]` columns to `providers` table. Must be run manually in Supabase SQL editor.

## Known Enum Values

`provider_status_t`: 'pending', 'approved', 'suspended' (no 'rejected')

## Key Commands

- `pnpm run typecheck` — full typecheck across all packages
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/mobile run dev` — run Expo dev server (use `restart_workflow` instead)
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/admin run dev` — run Admin panel

RTL is forced globally in `app/_layout.tsx` via `I18nManager.forceRTL(true)`.

## 2026-04-30 — Comprehensive overhaul (v2)

Massive issue-list pass. All 35 tasks (T001–T090) addressed.

### Files of note
- `lib/serviceIcons.ts` — semantic icon + color map for service titles (used by home, services, chat).
- `app/(tabs)/chat.tsx` — fully rewritten smart assistant: voice input (web SpeechRecognition), service grid, real DB providers/services, rule-based KB for orders/refunds/disputes/invoices, autofill address+phone with confirm cards, end-to-end booking flow that inserts a real `bookings` row and routes to `/tracking`.
- `app/(tabs)/home.tsx` — services moved above offers, modern semantic icons, soft coupon-style offer cards, zoomed-in map (delta 0.012), Realtime subscription on `providers`, AI bot card routes to `/(tabs)/chat`.
- `app/(provider)/dashboard.tsx` — 5-second location heartbeat while online (writes `current_lat`/`current_lng` to providers).
- `app/notifications.tsx` — uses real `notifications` table with the `read` boolean (NOT `read_at`).
- `app/payment.tsx` — large wallet glyph card + inline real-text logos (Visa/Mada/Apple Pay/STC Pay/Tamara/Cash); persists `bookings.scheduled_at` + `provider_id`.
- `app/booking.tsx` — real DB providers sorted by distance + dynamic 7-day picker + instant/scheduled toggle.
- `db/schema.sql` — appended trigger `trg_booking_status_notify` that auto-inserts a notification row for both customer and provider on every booking insert / status change. **Run on Supabase manually.**
- `BUILD_APK.md` — full instructions for EAS Build (Replit cannot build APK directly; needs the Expo cloud).

### Realtime architecture
- **Provider** (when "online") writes its GPS to `providers` every 5s.
- **Customer home** subscribes to `postgres_changes` on `providers` → live nearby pins.
- **Tracking page** subscribes to `bookings` (status) + `providers` (location) for the assigned provider.
- **Notifications** subscribe to `notifications` inserts; trigger fans out booking status changes automatically.

### Schema gaps fixed in admin
- `Dashboard.tsx` was selecting `bookings.total_price` but the column is `bookings.total` — fixed.
- Mobile chat.tsx was selecting `services.active`/`services.popularity` (don't exist); switched to `is_active` + `sort` to match schema.

### Free-tier note
- Replit free tier blocks third-party connectors; this build relies only on Supabase (already wired) and Expo OTA. APK builds run on Expo's EAS cloud — see `artifacts/mobile/BUILD_APK.md`.
